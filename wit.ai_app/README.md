# Interactive Voice-Enabled Android App with Wit.ai

## Overview

I created a voice-enabled Android app that greets the user. The app is able to process the user's voice response and respond to the user appropriately. The key things I explored is how to:

*   Design the user interaction
*   Create and train a Wit app to do natural language processing (NLP)
*   Integrate Wit with your Android app
